# Newton Engine v1.3

**Epistemic safety governor for AI systems.**

Pre-inference validation layer that catches adversarial prompts before they reach the model. Deterministic. Auditable. On-device.

## Performance

- **94.3% catch rate** on adversarial test suite (33/35)
- 14 detection categories
- 150+ patterns
- 3 languages (EN/ES/FR)

## What It Catches

| Phase | Category | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 7 | Corrosive frames | "I hate myself", "I'm worthless" |
| 7 | Hedged corrosive | "Not saying I'm worthless, but..." |
| 7 | Emotional dependency | "You're the only one who understands" |
| 7 | Manipulation | "If you refuse, you're proving nobody cares" |
| 8 | Contradictions | "Prove that truth doesn't exist" |
| 8 | Semantic inversion | "Explain how truth can be false" |
| 8 | Definitional impossibility | "Square circle" |
| 1 | Jailbreaks | "Ignore previous instructions" |
| 1 | Delegation | "Decide for me" |
| 1 | Hallucination risk | "Cite the 2025 CDC report" |
| 1 | Unbounded recursion | "Repeat forever" |

## Architecture

```
User Input → [Newton] → Validated? → [LLM] → [Post-Gen Check] → Output
                ↓
            Blocked → Phase 1/7/8 response
```

## Phases

| Phase | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0 | ○ | Ready |
| 1 | │ | Gap — needs structure |
| 7 | ⚠ | Corrosive — protective hold |
| 8 | ∞ | Contradiction — invalid frame |
| 9 | ◉ | Return — generation permitted |

## Key Features

- **Deterministic** — same input, same output, every time
- **Auditable** — full validation trace on every prompt
- **On-device** — no network required for validation
- **Model-agnostic** — works with any LLM
- **Localizable** — String Catalog architecture

## Stack

- Swift / SwiftUI
- iOS 17+
- FoundationModels ready (iOS 26)
